        I am a public relations major and an information management technology minor. I am looking to pursue a career in entertainment public relations. I recently completed an internship at The LEDE Company on the branding team. Also, I work at Z89 Radio, where I serve as the broadcasting consultant. Outside of work, I enjoy playing tennis and traveling. I recently studied abroad in London and traveled the world. My favorite shows are Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm and The Office.
