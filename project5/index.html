            <p> Hi! I am Chloe Davis, a public relations major and information management technology minor looking to pursue a career in entertainment public relations. I recently completed an internship at The LEDE Company on the branding team, working with high-end clients such as Theory, Isabel Marant, and KENZO. In addition, I spend much of my time at Z89 Radio as a broadcasting consultant.  </p> 

            <p> Outside of school, I have a passion for photography. This love for the camera stems from my grandpa and my father. My grandfather had a dark room in his house, constantly developing incredible photographs. My father developed a love for photography from my grandfather and spread that love to me. He bought me my first camera in sixth grade; since then, Iâ€™ve taken hundreds of photographs of my travels. </p>   
            
            <p>I recently studied abroad in London and traveled throughout Europe, visiting over ten countries and capturing amazing photos along the way.</p>
